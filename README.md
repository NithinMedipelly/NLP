We have presented a RAG-enhanced pipeline for clinical report deidentification that combines transformer-based NER with retrieval from domain specific knowledge sources. Our comprehensive evaluation on the i2b2 2014 and MIMIC III datasets shows that this approach outperforms strong transformer baselines, particularly on ambiguous PHI categories such as hospital names and locations. Retrieval augmentation enables the model to leverage external evidence that is not fully captured in its parameters, leading to more accurate and reliable PHI detection.
In future work, we plan to extend our framework to multi-lingual clinical corpora and investigate cross-institutional transfer learning scenarios. We also aim to explore tighter integration between retrieval and generation components, enabling end-to end optimization of deidentification quality under explicit privacy and utility constraints.
